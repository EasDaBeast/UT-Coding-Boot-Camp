when the user pushes a key
    make sure they picked a rock, paper, or scissors
        if they don't pick one, scold them fiercely
    have the computer pick one
    then compare the two

    decide a winner
        if the user picked rock
            and if the computer picked rock
                it's a tie
            and if the computer picked paper
                the computer wins (the user loses)
            and if the computer picked scissors
                the human wins
        repeat for paper
        repeat for scissors

    keep track of scores
        if user wins, increase the number of wins
        if computer wins, increase the number of losses
